# DeathForest
Flash 2D ActionScript

This is a project that I made as a final task in 2015 for the institute where I learnt game programming.

ItÂ´s a 2D shooter game, in which you have to take the necessary materials to build the house while you kill all enemies of each level.  

CONTROLS:
A,W,S,D  <--- Move
Space <--- Shoot

Each level is more difficult than previous one, for example: You start first level killing 2 frogs and taking 4 logs of wood, and in last level you have to take 4 logs of woods, 5 rocks, 6 diamonds, killing more than 8 enemies and trying not to die of thirst.

I made the design and the programming of the entire game.
